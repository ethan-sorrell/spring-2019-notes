CS-575 Programming Project by Ethan Sorrell

Included are 3 folders: assign1, assign2, assign3
Each folder has the structures ./src/$PACKAGE_NAME$/ where $PACKAGE_NAME$ is the name given to that package.
Within each of these src folders there are several example inputs and an example test script, test.sh
From the src folder, each project can be compiled using:
javac $PACKAGE_NAME$/Main.java
where $PACKAGE_NAME$ is the sole folder found in src
Then each program may be executed by:
java $PACKAGE_NAME$/Main $INPUT_FILE$
where again $PACKAGE_NAME$ is the sole folder found in src, and $INPUT_FILE$ is the desired input file.
Alternatively, the respective test.sh files may be examined to see the format of these commands.
