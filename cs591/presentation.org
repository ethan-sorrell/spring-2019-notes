There are several levels at which we can analyze a query using nlp
NLP is especially important for all the bells & whistles of modern IR systems.
Query Expansion

- Phonetic level
  - Most important for voice recognition systems
  - Could also be useful for advanced error correction/spell checking systems
- Morphological Level
  - Thinking stemming
- Syntactic Level
  - Parsing the structure of a query.
  - John sues Jane vs. Jane sues John
  - Understanding object vs. subject of a verb
  - More advanced systems can start to classify different types of verbs
  - Action vs Possession vs Equivalence
  - WAIT
  - Some techniques include Tagging and FSA
  - Also CFG
- Semantic Level
  - Beyond the meaning derived from structure is meaning of individual words. Can be context dependent
  - Tie the bow vs. Tie the score
- Discourse Level
  - Higher-level structure (document structure)
  - Most research papers will begin with an abstract which summarizes the rest of the document
  - Useful for summarization and weighting methods
- Pragmatic Level
  - Requires context that can't be gathered from the query alone
  - Think Watson or Siri. 
  - "What was the weather like three years ago, on this day?"

- Tagging
  - Each word is given a tag e.g. Adjective, Verb, Preposition
  - 87-tag tagset that's pretty common, but it's really at the discretion of the designer
  - Most words are easy/unambiguous, but many words are ambiguous
  - Rule-based or deterministic vs. Stochastic or Probabilistic
  - ELIZA and Prolog
  - Now Deep Learning and Machine Learning

- Lexical Analysis (morphological level, syntactic level, semantic level)
  - n-grams (basically word phrases)
  - Useful for prediction, spell-checking, expansion
  - Example of using bi-grams to predict the next word:
    - P(w_2|w_1) = P(w_1|w_2)P(w_2) / P(w_1)
    - P(w_1) cancels out since it will be the same for all possible w_2


- "text retrieval systems also add or create knowledge bases with internal lexicons, semantic networks, or lists of phraes, synonyms"
- CFG and FSA examples
- More on rule based vs probabilistic
