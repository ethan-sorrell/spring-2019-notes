Computer Communications and Networks
* Chapter 1: Introduction
- Computer Networks :: interconnected collection of autonomous computers
- Autonomous :: no master/slave relation
- Distributed Systems are higher layer than Computer Network
** Social Issues
- Network Neutrality :: Argument for communications that are not differentiated by content or source
- Content Ownership issues :: DMCA takedowns etc
- Anonymity
- Privacy
- Theft, malicious activity
** Network Hardware
*** Taxonomy by Transmission Media
- Wired Networks:
  - Twisted pair
  - Coaxial Cable
  - Fiber Optics
- Wireless Networks:
  - Radio Transmission
  - Microwave
  - Satellites
- Wired-Wireless Integrated Networks
*** Taxonomy by Transmission Technology 
- Broadcast Links
  - Single Channel Shared by all machines.
  - Packets sent by one are received by all (broadcasted).
  - Upon receiving a packet, each machine checks if the packet is relevant: either received or ignored
  - Broadcasting :: one to all
  - Multicasting :: one to a group/subset
- Point-to-Point Links
  - Many connections between individual pairs of machines
  - A packet may travel through many intermediate machines otw to destination
  - Routing play important role
- Localized networks tend to use broadcasting
- Large networks tend to use point-to-point
*** Taxonomy by Scale
| Scale    | Type                            |
|----------+---------------------------------|
| Vicinity | PAN (Personal Area Network)     |
| Building | LAN (Local Area Network)        |
| City     | MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) |
| Country  | WAN (Wide Area Network)         |
| Planet   | The Internet                    |
- PAN :: Bluetooth PAN, computer connmail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inboxected to printer, speaker, keyboard
- LAN :: Devices connected in a home to a common access point or ethernet switch.
- MAN :: A metropolitan area network based on cable TV
- WAN :: Cover a country or continent. An ISP network is a WAN. A VPN is also a WAN.
- Internetwork :: A collection of interconnected networks. The most obvious example is the internet.
** Network Protocol
- Protocol layering is the main structuring method used to divide up network functionality.
- At each layer, peers communicate with each other virtually. The communications are actualized by underlying layers. (lower-level of abstraction)
- These lower layer _services_ are accessed by an _interface_
- At bottom, messages are physically transmitted via the medium.
- Layers, protocols, and interfaces.
- Layers :: make complicated protocols more manageable. Provides information hiding/decoupling. This allows them to be changed with minimal hassle.
- Protocol :: An a priori agreement between the communicating parties on how the communication is to proceed.
- Lower layers protocols often contain additional header information including things like sequence number (e.g. if we needed to split our message into multiple parts), address, size, time, and/or other control fields.
- Additionally, some networks have size limits, which means that we may have to split our message into multiple parts when moving to lower level protocols.
** Design Issues for the Layers
- Addressing :: A way to uniquely identify senders and receivers
- Error Control :: error-detecting and correcting mechanism
- Order :: Mechanism & out of order control, such as buffers
- Flow Control :: Deal with problems e.g. A fast sender overwhelming a slow receiver, agreed-on transmission rate for senders.
- Fragmentation :: put into small packets to transmit separately
- *Multiplexing*
- Routing :: decision on transmitting path among many available paths.
- Each layer solves a particular problem but must include mechanisms to address a set of recurring design issues.
| Issues                       | Example mechanism                                             |
|------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Robust to failures           | Codes for error detection/correction, routing around failures |
| Network growth and evolution | Addressing and naming, Protocol layering                      |
| Allocation of resources      | Multiple access, congestion control                           |
| Security                     | Confidentiality of messages, Authentication                   |
** Connection-oriented vs Connectionless Services
- Connection-oriented:
  - A connection is built before transmission occur
  - e.g. TCP, seems that all packets go to the same path, but not really.
- Connectionless:
  - No connection is setup e.g. postal service
  - Each packet must carry destination address, and each packet may take different path
  - e.g. UDP
| Connection Type | Service                 | Example              |
|-----------------+-------------------------+----------------------|
| Connection-     | Reliable message stream | Sequence of pages    |
| Oriented        | Reliable byte stream    | Remote Login         |
|                 | Unreliable connection   | Digitzed voice       |
| Connectionless  | Unreliable datagram     | Electronic junk mail |
|                 | Acknowledged datagram   | Registered mail      |
|                 | Request-reply           | Database query       |
** Service Primitives
- Five service primitives for implementing a simple connection-oriented service.
- TCP socket programming has these functions
- Two "blocks"
- Connectionless service use only SEND
| Primitive  | Meaning                                    |
|------------+--------------------------------------------|
| LISTEN     | Block waiting for an incoming connection   |
| CONNECT    | Establish a connection with a waiting peer |
| RECEIVE    | Block waiting for an incoming message      |
| SEND       | Send a message to the peer                 |
| DISCONNECT | Terminate a connection                     |
** Service to Protocol Relationship
- A service is a set of primitives that a layer provides to the layer above. Says nothing about implementation
- A protocol is a set of rules governing the format and meaning of the packets.
- Analogy: Abstract Data Type is to Implementation as Service is to Protocol
** Reference Models
- OSI Reference Model
- TCP/IP Reference Model
** OSI Reference Model
   [[file:img/cs538/osi_model.png]]
- From bottom up:
  - Physical Layer :: Transmitting raw bits over physical medium
  - Data Link Layer :: Break messages into data frames and transmit them sequentially.
    - Error Control: Ack
    - Flow Control: traffic regulation, buffer size
    - For broadcast networks, how to control access to the shared medium: Medium Access Control sublayer.
- Session Layer :: Allows users on different machines to establish "sessions" between them
- Presentation Layer :: Syntax and semantics of the information transmitted.
- Application Layer :: Applications above such as HTTP, WWW, FTP, Email
*** In Summary
- OSI is a principled international standard with seven layers:
** TCP/IP Reference Model
- Derives from ARPANET
- Doesn't use Presentation or Session layer from OSI Reference Model
- From 7 layers to 5.
*** Layers 
- Internet Layer
  - Internet Protocol (IP)
  - Connectionless service
  - Routing & Congestion control
- Transport Layer
  - End-to-end protocols
  - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): reliable connection-oriented protocol
  - User Datagram Protocol (UDP): unreliable, connectionless protocol
- Application Layer
  - TELNET, FTP, SMTP, etc.
- Host-to-Network Layer
  - Not defined in TCP/IP Model
*** Protocols in Different Layers
| Layer       | Protocols                    |
|-------------+------------------------------|
| Application | HTTP, SMTP, RTP, DNS         |
| Transport   | TCP, UDP                     |
| Internet    | IP, ICMP                     |
| Link        | DSL, SONET, 802.11, Ethernet |
- Example of differences in application layer protocols:
  Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) may not need to retransmit lost packets, because in a real-time scenario like voip, these packets are not needed if they are late.
** OSI Model vs TCP/IP Model
 - OSI model distinguishes
   - Services
   - Interfaces
   - Protocols
   - OOP concept: method, attributes, implementations
 - OSI was created before the protocols were defined.
 - TCP/IP was created after protocols were defined
 - OSI was very influential and had clear goals/concepts, but was bogged down by complexity and politics.
 - TCP/IP had very successful protocols, but a weak model derived later.
*** Why OSI failed
 - Bad timing
 - Bad technology: many layers, complex and redundant
 - Bad implementation
 - Politics
 - See "two elephants"
** A Critique of the TCP/IP Reference Model
 Problems:
 - Service, interface, and protocol are not distinguished
 - Not a general model
 - Host-to-network "layer" not really a layer
 - No mention of physical and data link layers
 - Minor protocols are deeply entrenched and hard to replace
** Internet: The ARPANET
- From ARPANET to Internet
  - ARPANET is a research network sponsored by DoD
  - later connected hundreds of universities and government installations using leased telephone lines
  - Had trouble when satellite and radio networks were added
  - TCP/IP begins in 70s
  - TCP/IP was built into the linux kernel
*** Architecture
- First Dialup reuse phone lines
- DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) improved on this by sending digital transmission over these lines.
- These require DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer) which convert between digital and analog signal
- ISP networks may be regional, national, or international
- Tier 1 ISPs are the largest of these providers. They are the backbone of the internet.
- IXP (Internet eXchange Point) these are points where ISPs connect their networks to exchange traffic
- Within each network routers switch packets
- Between networks, traffic exchange is set by business agreements.
- Customers connect to the network by many means:
  - Cable, DSL, Fiber, 3G/4G, Dialup
*** Cellular Phone Systems
- 1st Generation [AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System)]: limited channels, analog
- 2nd Generation [GSM (Global System for Mobile communications), DAMPS, CDMA]: Digital
  - DAMPS created to be backwards compatible with AMPS
- 3rd Generation [UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), also called WCDMA (Wideband Code Division Multiple Access)]: Digital, both voice and data, up to 14 Mbps down, 6 Mbps up.
- 4th Generation: integrated
*** 3G Mobile Phone Networks
- 3G Network is based on spatial cells. Each cell services mobile devices via a base station.
- As mobile devices move, base stations hand them off from one cell to the next 
- UMTS Network:
  - Phone connects to base station (node B)
  - Base stations connect to Radio Network Controller. Here traffic is divided between data and voice signals.
- Previously this was a *hard handover*, where a cellphone would stop connection with one tower and begin connection with another. Today, we have *soft handover* because cellphones have multiple antenna and make begin connection to next tower before terminating previous connection 
*** Wireless LAN
- Signals in the 2.4 GHz ISM band vary in strength due to many effects, such as multi-path fading due to reflections. As such, required complex transmission schemes e.g. OFDM
- CSMA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access) designs are used because the range of a single radio may not cover the entire system, and multiple radios may incompletely overlap or interfere.
- But instead, most WLANs simply are not Ad Hoc networks, but instead make use of an Access Point.
** RFID and Sensor Networks
- Passive networks in everyday objects:
  - Tags are placed on objects
  - Readers send signals that the tags reflect to communicate
  - UHF RFID (Ultra-high Frequency) :: most common, 902-928 MHz band, distance of several meters
  - HF RFID (High Frequency) :: 13.56 MHz, used in passports, credit cards, books, etc.
- Active RFID also occurs.
- Sensor networks spread small devices over an area. These devices send sensor data to collectors.
** Network Standardization
- ITU (International Telecommunication Union), an agency of the UN
- Additionally, we have:
  - ISO (International Standards Organization)
  - NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
  - IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers)
** Network Standardization
- When the ARPANET was set up, DoD created an informal committee to oversee it. Called the IAB (Internet Activities Board)
- Later changed to Internet Architecture Board
- Published a series of technical reports called RFCs (request for comments)
- Then, in 1989, the IRTF (Internet Research Task Force) and IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force).
- IRTF concentrates on long-term research while IETF focuses on short-term engineering issues
- Later, the Internet Society was created. It is governed by elected trustees who appoint the IAB's members.
- RFCs can become standards, but a process must be followed. To advance to the Draft Standard stage, a working implementation must have been rigorously tested by at least two independent sites for at least 4 months.
- If the IAB is convinced, it can declare the RFC to be an Internet Standard.
- Standards define what is needed for inter-operability
| Body | Area               | Example Standards  |
|------+--------------------+--------------------|
| ITU  | Telecommunications | G.992, ADSL        |
|      |                    | H.264, MPEG4       |

* Chapter 2: The Physical Layer
** Introduction
- It is the foundation on which other layers are built. 
- Key problem is to send digital message (bits) using only analog signals (modulation)
- Information transmitted on wires by varying physical properties such as voltage/current.
** Fourier Analysis
- In early 19th century, Fourier proved that any reasonably behaved periodic function g(t) with period T,
\begin{equation}
g(t)=\frac{1}{2}c+ \sum^\inf_{n=1}a_nsin(2\pi n ft) + \sum^\inf_{n=1}b_ncos(2\pi nft)
\end{equation}
- where f = 1/T, the fundamental frequency
- a_n & b_n, amplitudes of nth harmonics
- c, constant
- Imagining that a data signal with a finite duration is periodic (repeats indefinitely), we can analyze signals using Fourier techniques.
- See slides for Fourier Analysis of an example signal.
- Fourier Analysis can tell us about the amplitude of our signal at different harmonic numbers.
** Bandwidth-Limited Signals
- Transmission lose some power.
- But all Fourier components are not equally diminished. Higher frequency components lose more power.
- This introduces distortion.
- Usually, in a wire, amplitudes are transmitted mostly undiminished. But frequencies above a cutoff frequency are diminished.
- The width of the frequency range transmitted without strong attenuation is called the *bandwidth*
- In practice, the cutoff is somewhat arbitrary, quoted as the frequency at which received power has fallen by half.
- The bandwidth is a physical property of the specific transmission medium.
- Filters are often used to further limit the bandwidth of a signal.
- 802.11 wireless channels use up to roughly 20 MHz, so the 802.11 radios filter the signal bandwidth to this size.
- Another example, television channels occupy 6 MHz each. This filtering lets more signals share a given region of spectrum which improves the overall efficiency of the system.
- It means that the frequency range for some signals will not start at 0 (passband).
- Signals that run from 0 up to a maximum frequency are called *baseband* signals.
- Signals that are shifted to occupy a higher range of frequencies (as is the case for all wireless transmissions) are called *passband* signals.
[[file:img/cs538/bandwidth-limited-signal.png]]
- Having less bandwidth (fewer harmonics) degrades the signal
- An ordinary telephone line, often called a *voice-grade line* has an artificially introduced cutoff frequency just above 3000 Hz.
- This means that the number of the highest harmonic passed through is roughly 3000/(L/8) or 24000/L
- (L/8 because 8-bits in a byte)
[[file:img/cs538/bandwidth-table.png]]
- The table above shows that we can increase transmission rate, by decreasing number of harmonics sent, but this degrades our signal. Eventually it will be incomprehensible. We need at least ~8 harmonics.
- In fact, we can achieve higher data rates with coding schemes that make use of several voltage levels.
- Just note the ambiguity between analog bandwidth (frequency) and digital bandwidth (data rate)
** The Maximum Data Rate of a Channel 
- In 1924, an AT&T engineer, Henry Nyquist, realized that even a perfect channel has a finite transmission capacity.
- In 1948, Claude Shannon carried the work further and extended it to the case of a channel subject to random noise. (most important paper in information theory)
- *low-pass filter* is a filter that attenuates signals with frequencies higher than a cutoff
- *sampling* is the reduction of a continuous signal to a discrete signal.
- Nyquist showed that a signal run through a low-pass filter of bandwidth B, the signal can be reconstructed by making 2B samples per second.
- Nyquist's theorem
  - maximum data rate = 2B log_2 V bits/sec
  - where signal consists of V discrete levels
- SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio): S/N, but normally 10 log_10 S/N
  - for signal power S and noise power N
  - this scale is used due to the high range of possible S/N ratios
- Units of log: decibels (dB)
- An S/N ratio of 10 is 10 dB, ratio of 100 is 20 dB, ratio of 1000 is 30, etc.
- Shannon's maximum data rate or *capacity* with Bandwidth B & S/N:
  - maximum bits/sec = B log_2 (1 + S/N)
- Example: ADSL with 1 MHz and SNR=40dB we get 13 Mbps. In practice, ADSL is specified up to 12 Mbps.
- digital repeaters can be used to amplify signal and improve SNR.
** Guided Transmission Data
- Magnetic Media
- Twisted Pair
- Coaxial Cable
- Power Lines
- Fiber Optics
*** Magnetic Media
- If high bandwidth + cost per bit is the key factor, it can be cost effective to ship hard disks.
- "Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes hurtling down the highway"
*** Twisted Pair 
- The oldest and most common media. A twisted pair of insulated copper wires.
- Category 3 UTP (old)
- Category 5 UTP (new)
- UTP :: Unshielded Twisted Pair
- Category 5 UTP has 4 twisted pairs. 100 Mbps Ethernet uses 2 for each direction.
*** Link Terminology
- Full-duplex link :: transmission in both directions simultaneously
- Half-duplex link :: both directions, but not at the same time
- Simplex link :: Fixed direction; uncommon
*** Coaxial Cable
- Longer distances at better speeds and less noise than twisted pairs
*** Power Lines
- Convenient, but in general does a horrible job.
- An older idea, used by electricity companies for low-rate communication such as remote metering as well as in the home to control devices.
- In more recent years, high-rate communication over these lines both inside the home as LAN and outside the home for broadband access.
- Problems:
  - Electrical properties (wiring) vary from home to home and change as in-home power usage changes (e.g. turning on a drier or space heater)
  - Additionally transient currents (appliances turned on and off) create electrical noise
  - Despite these difficulties, it is practical to send at least 100 Mbps over typical household electrical wiring using the right communication schemes.
- Electrical signals at 50-60 Hz and attenuates at higher frequency for high-rate data communication.
*** Fiber Optics
- Increase in computation speed and communication speeds have historically been relatively similar.
- Both around 16x per decade.
- CPUs are approaching speed limitations
- Fiber can be very fast, but is expensive.
- Key for fiber, is to have reflection angle such that all light is reflected and none refracted
- Multimode fiber :: many different rays bouncing around at different angle
- Single-mode fiber
  - Fiber's diameter is reduced to be very short. Light propagates like a straight line. More expensive, but more effective (longer travel distance)
- Fiber has enormous bandwidth (THz) and tiny signal loss
*** Fiber Cables
- Single fiber
  - has core so narrow (10 microns) light can not bounce around
  - Used with lasers for long distances
- Multiple fiber
  - Light can bounce (50 micron core)
  - Used with LEDs for cheaper, shorter distance links
** Electromagnetic Spectrum
- To manage interference, use of spectrum is regulated and licensed e.g. sold at auction.
- In addition, there are also unlicensed (ISM) bands. Free for use at lower power.
  - Used for networking; WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.
- FHSS (frequency hopping spread spectrum_ :: hops from frequency to frequency hundreds of times per second. Popular for military as its hard to detect and jam
- CDMA (code division multiple access) :: uses different codes for multi-plexing
- DSSS (direct sequence spread spectrum) :: uses a code sequence to spread the data signal over a wider frequency band. Used to let multiple signals share same frequency band
- UWB (ultra-wideband) :: sends a series of rapid pulses, varying their positions to communication information.
*** Radio Transmission
- In the VLF, LF, and MF bands, radio waves follow the curvature of the earth.
- In the HF band, they bounce off the ionosphere.
*** Microwave Transmission
- Above 100 Mhz, waves travel in nearly straight lines.
- Satellite TV dish must be accurately aligned.
- MCI: Microwave Communications Inc.
  - Bought small plots every 50km for towers. Later acquired by verizon
- Microwave does not pass through buildings well.
- Increased demand has lead to use higher and higher frequencies
- Bands up to 10 GHz are now in routine use. Above 4 GHz absorption by rain/humidity becomes a problem
*** Infrared Transmission
- TV remote
** Politics of the Electromagnetic Spectrum
- US has FCC (Federal Communications Commission)
- Three algorithms:
  - Beauty Contest
    - Each carrier argues why its proposal serves public interest
    - Government officials decide
    - Leads to bribery and corruption
  - Lottery 
    - problem: companies with no interest enter the lottery then resell
  - Auction
    - create monopolistic environment
- The ISM (industrial, scientific, and medical) bands
  - Used by garage door openers, cordless phones, bluetooth, wifi, etc.
  - FCC mandates that devices in this band limit their transmit power and use other techniques to spread their signals over a range of frequencies
- FCC 2009 allows unlicensed use of white spaces around 700 MHz.
** Digital Modulation and Multiplexing
- Digital modulation :: converting between bits and signals
- Baseband transmission :: signals occupy frequencies from zero up to a max
  - particularly for non-optical wired channels
- Passband transmission :: signals occupy a band of frequencies around frequency of carrier signal
  - used by most other types of channels
*** Baseband transmission
- NRZ (Non-return-to-zero) scheme
  - Use a positive voltage to represent a 1 and a negative voltage to represent 0
  - Sense there is no return to 0, precise timing is requires to decode streams of repeating bits e.g. was the stream 5 consecutive 0s or 4 consecutive?
